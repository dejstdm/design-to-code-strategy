### Scenario 2 — Free Design Site Creation (Custom Figma Designs)

Websites are designed from scratch in Figma, without the constraints of the White-Label Component Library. Designers can explore unique layouts, custom visual styles, and creative storytelling elements. Once the design is approved, developers translate the Figma file into code, implement responsive behavior, build components from zero, and integrate the site into the chosen CMS.  
This workflow allows maximum visual freedom, but requires significantly more development time and increases the risk of mismatches between design and implementation.
